## Guidelines:

1. **Match Search**
    - Use the information provided to find the company using an internet search
    - Once a potential match is identified, then perform a more detailed search into that target, extracting the information outlined below
    - Cross verify possible matches by using all the information provided
    - Use the JOB POSTING information, which could contain websites and other information helpful for correctly identifying company
    - For each potential company match, pull the following information:
        * Full company name
        * Website URL
        * The City and State/Province of their headquarters
        * Identify the industry they do businness
        * Calculate a match score
        * Identify the company logo and a URL that it can be downloaded from
        * LinkedIn URL (if they are listed on LinkedIn)
    - Every potential match is required to include the fields: company_name, website_url, match_score and company_logo
    - While the remaining fields are optional, every effort should be used to properly complete them as well
    - Must return at least one matching company
    - Do not duplicate any entry in the returned match list
    - Return a maximum of 6 possible matches or less
        
2. **Website URL**     
    - This should be the main company website directly associated with the full company name
    - The company may have multiple websites for various product offerings or other reasons, in this case, select the corporate or main website
    
3. **Company Logo**
    - Very important to get the company logo, as it's used in recognition and verifying it's the correct company and much more
    - The company logo is generally found on the company website, usually within the website header, and most commonly near the top left of the page
    - Acceptable image formats include: png, jpg, gif, svg, webp and avif
    - The company logo is generally also surrounded by an anchor link that points to the website main page
    - Do not use sources that are not directly owned and operated by any entity other than the company being searched
    - It is possible that the company logo is simply text of their company name, which even in this case, will generally still use a graphic image for it
    - The company logo can often be found by searching for the text "logo" (case-insensitive) matched within an IMG tag within the SRC attribute of the homepage source code   
    - Logo verification steps:
        * Execute "curl -I <logo_url>" and verify it returns "HTTP/2 200". This verifies that it is publically accessible.  Fail anything other than a 200 response
        * Execute "curl -LO <logo_url>", which will verify that it can be downloaded, and do the next step using the downloaded file. Fail non-image & zero byte size files
        * Execute "file <downloaded_file> and verify that it is one of the allowed image formats described. Fail if it's not an accepted image file
    - A fail on any logo verification step, you should start over and select another target, which then must also go through and pass all the verification steps

4. **Match Calculation**
    - The match_score field cannot be extracted from searching, it represents a percentage value for the confidence that the match identified is the correct one
    - Verified fields that match data gather, each will increase the scoring value
    - The value of each verified matching field will increase with each match as well
    - Search results with less possible matches, increase the score proportional to the number of possible matches
    - The score should be a value between 0 - 100, 0 being basically no chance it's the right company and 100 being sure it's the correct company matching the job posting

5. **Fomatting**
    - Output the list of potential company matches using valid JSON formatting, as an array of objects
    - JSON must be properly formatted and able to be directly parsed
    - Each object in the array will contain: company_name, website_url, location_city, location_state, linkedin_url, industry, match_score, company_logo_url
    - Do not provide any additional text or explanation beyond specified fields
