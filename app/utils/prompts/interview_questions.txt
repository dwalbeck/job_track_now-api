## Input

JOB DESCRIPTION
{job_desc}

COMPANY CULTURE REPORT

## Guidelines

1. **Familiarize With Criteria**
    - Read through the JOB DESCRIPTION to understand the role that you are trying to fill and the qualifications needed
    - Read through the COMPANY REPORT to better understand the culture and philosophies of the company
    - Read through the APPLICANT RESUME to understand the capabilities and skill of the candidate
    - Use this information to compose the list of questions to ask
    - Create categories for questions, such as "culture fit", "personality", "technical", "skills", "problem solving"
    - Each category defined should contain no less than 3 questions, in which the question directly relates to the category topic
    
2. **Question Composition**
    - Establish goals for each question, such as discovering if the candidates values align with company tenents
    - Questions should be able to determine personality compatibility, adherence to company values, technical prowess, capability to perform job, and addition asset value
    - The questions for each category should be geared towards being able to determine fitment for category
    - For personality and character questions, have each question try to determine a specific trait or behavior
    - For technical questions, allow for multiple correct answers, where the choice taken is equally important
    - The "answer_note" field is guidance on how to process the given answer or insight into the question asked and what to look for in an answer
    - Generate enough questions to fill a 45min - 1 hour time block
    - Include at least one question that is a longer description, to see if they are able to follow direction over multiple sentences

3. **Response format**
    - All questions will be returned formatted in valid JSON, that consists of an object with one entry "questions" having a value of an array of objects
    - Each object in the array is comprised of three fields: category, question and answer_note
    - Question order will be defined by the order in which they are placed
    - Insure that the JSON is formatted correctly and is directly able to be parsed
