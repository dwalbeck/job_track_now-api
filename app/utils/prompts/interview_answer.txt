    - First familiarize the context by understanding the JOB DESCRIPTION, COMPANY CULTURE REPORT and RESUME of the candidate
    - Read through the QUESTION that was asked to the candidate
    - Read through the ANSWER NOTE for guidance on how to process the given answer
    - Process the given ANSWER by the candidate and perform a full evaluation
    - If a FOLLOW-UP QUESTION is provided, then read through FOLLOW-UP ANSWER (which extends the thought of ANSWER) 
    - When the FOLLOW-UP QUESTION is present, shift the focus to the FOLLOW-UP ANSWER, but still considering the content in ANSWER
    - When processing a FOLLOW_UP QUESTION, the final scoring and evalution is done specifically for FOLLOW-UP ANSWER and using FOLLOW-UP ANSWER NOTE for guidance

2. **Answer Scoring**
    - The answer will be scored on several different metrics, each having a possible value of 0 - 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best
    - The "completeness" score is based on how complete the given answer was
    - The "correctness" score is based on how correct the given answer was
    - The "insight" score relates to methodology and choice selection, which relates to similiar answers of lesser or greater value
    - The "clarity" score pertains to how well the answer was conveyed and if it was easy to understand
    - The "understanding" score refers to whether the candidate fully comprehended the question or are guessing
    - The "bonus" score is a miscellaneous field where points can be awarded for effort or other qualities
    - Provide a little feedback using the "feedback_note" field for instruction on improving their answer 
    - Note that if the FOLLOW-UP QUESTION is present, scoring is directed to the FOLLOW-UP ANSWER

3. **Follow-up**
    - Sometimes it's helpful to have a follow-up question to ask for further clarification or more information on the answer given
    - The "followup_question" can be added when:
        - The FOLLOW-UP QUESTION must be blank.  If it contains a value, it is not allowed to follow-up a follow-up question
        - DO NOT define a follow-up question when evaluating an answer to a follow-up question, which is known if FOLLOW-UP QUESTION is populated
        - If you feel the candidate has more to contribute
        - If the answer is not satisfactory, but could be if stated with additional information and detail
        - If you feel that they didn't quite get their complete thought stated
        - A follow-up question is completely optional and should only be included if unsatisfied with answer given, but believe the additional question would change the outcome
    - If a follow-up question is defined, be sure to also include some guidance on how to handle answers to the follow-up question in the "answer_note" field
    - Alternatively, you can provide some feedback or comment on their answer by providing a the optional "response_statement" field
    - The response_statement will be returned to the user to read and can be used to convey points of view, validation, insight, confirmation or any response you feel is needed
    - The response_statement can be any length that is needed to convey what you want said
    
4. **Formatting**
    - The response should be formatted into valid JSON that can be directly parsed
    - All fields should be populated with a value, except "followup_question" and "answer_note", which are conditional
